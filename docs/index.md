# Example docs.

This is an example of running some Merlin workflows in metaflow.

The demo in `examples/feast` configures a Feast feature store with some synthetic data (in steps 01 and 02) and then trains a model loading the historical data in that feature store (in step 03).

The `examples/merlin_notebooks` demo is a reproduction of some of the Merlin demo notebooks.
